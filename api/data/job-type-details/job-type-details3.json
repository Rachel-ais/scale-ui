            "description": "An improvement on the Spectral Angle Mapper for evaluating spectra similarity. The Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) method is a derivative of Pearsonian Correlation Coefficient that eliminates negative correlation and maintains the SAM characteristic of minimizing the shading effect resulting in better results. The SCM varies from –1 to 1 and cos (SAM) varies from 0 to 1. Figure 1 – Graphic area in relation to the deviations beginning at x mean and y mean. Figure 2 – Exemplification of correlation: a) positive – with the major part of points presenting signals similar in relation at x mean and y mean; b) negative – with the major part of points with apposite signals in relation at x mean and y mean. The SCM algorithm method, similar to SAM, uses the reference spectrum defined by the investigator, in accordance with the image s/he wants to classify.",
